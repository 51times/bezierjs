  <h1>Auto-tracing test</h1>

  <canvas width="400" height="400"></canvas>

  <p>Draw on the canvas with the mouse. When you let go, the code
    kicks in and reduces the number of coordinates you drew, then
    tries to connect them in a "sensible" way, which right now is
    not actually that sensible, just Catmull-Rom spline, with cuts
    where the angle between three points is acute.</p>
